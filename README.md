# ANT
An archive of some of the programming assignments and my solutions for the Advanced Numerical Techniques lab in during the last semester of MSc. (2021) Physics at Delhi University. I will be trying to replicate the codes in py and also improve upon them. Students currently enrolled in the ANT-lab at DU might find it useful. Suggestions are welcomed. 
## Note: Assignments and their corresponding outputs (usually graphs) are attached as issues while the codes are in the main.
