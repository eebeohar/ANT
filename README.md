# ANT
An archive of programming assignments and my solutions (as they were submitted) for the Advanced Numerical Techniques lab in during the last semester of MSc. (2021) Physics at Delhi University. I will be trying to replicate the codes in py and also improve upon them. Students currently enrolled in the ANT-lab at DU might find it useful. Suggestions are welcomed. Note that I will not be uploading solutions for the IA or final exam however if you're stuck anywhere, feel free to contact me.
